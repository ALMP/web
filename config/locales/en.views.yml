         <p>7. JURISDICTION AND GOVERNING LAW</p>
         <p>These ToU are governed by Singapore’s law which will be applied to any claim, cause of action or dispute that might arise between you and the Fairpard irrespective to potential conflict of law provisions. By accessing and using the Fairpard you irrevocably agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in Singapore and stipulate to the fairness and convenience of proceedings in such courts for all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of Fairpard. You agree that all claims you may have against Fairpard arising from or relating to Fairpard must be heard and resolved in a court of competent subject matter jurisdiction located in Singapore.</p>
         <br/>
         <p>8. OTHER</p>
         <p>You acknowledge and agree that it is not the purpose of ToU and/or the Fairpard to create a partnership, joint venture or similar arrangement between you and the Fairpard whereby the parties could be held jointly liable vis-a-vis third parties or for any other purposes.</p>
         <p>ToU, together with any other terms and conditions referenced herein, constitutes the entire agreement between you and the Faipard and supersedes any and all prior agreements, understandings and arrangements, oral or written, between them with respect to the subject matter hereof.  If any provision of ToU shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity of all other provisions hereof shall in no way be affected thereby, and ToU shall be construed and be enforceable as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had not been included in this terms of use</p>
         <p>Our performance of ToU is subject to existing laws and legal process, and nothing contained in ToU limits our right to comply with law enforcement or other governmental or legal requests or requirements relating to your use of Fairpard or information provided to or gathered by us with respect to such use. To the extent allowed by applicable law, you agree that you will bring any claim or cause of action arising from or relating to your access or use of Fairpard within two (2) years from the date on which such claim or action arose or accrued or such claim or cause of action will be irrevocably waived.</p>
         <p>You hereby acknowledge and agree that the English version of ToU shall be the governing version and shall in all cases prevail over translation into any other language which is provided for reference only.</p>
    why_we:
      title: Our difference
      content_html: |
        <p><b>Fairpard</b> is a platform for creation and sharing of business histories – practices of doing business and interactions with specific companies, corporations or organizations.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>In this regard <b>Fairpard</b>:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>provides the platform for publication reviews on practices of doing business by B2B market players;</li>
        <li>publishes reviews submitted by business partners and employees of the companies, corporations or organizations;</li>
        <li>excludes from the reviews any data not related to doing business (for example, consumers’ reviews);</li>
        <li>covers manufacturers and service providers.</li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>Like credit histories, business histories help to ensure reliability, fairness and integrity of a business partner.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>Business histories also help the business to understand what needs to be improved to provide effectively the services or goods.</p>
