We believe that we’re only as good as the good we do.

All the facts and figures that talk to our size and diversity and years of history, as notable and IMPORTANT as they may be, are secondary to the truest measure of Deloitte: the impact we make in the world.

So, when people ask, “what’s different about Deloitte?” the answer resides in the many specific examples of where we have helped Deloitte member firm clients, our people, and sections of society to achieve remarkable goals, solve complex problems or make meaningful progress. Deeper still, it’s in the beliefs, behaviors and fundamental sense of purpose that underpin all that we do.

With over 150 years of hard work and commitment to making a real difference, our organization has grown in scale and diversity—approximately 245,000 people in 150 countries and territories, providing audit, tax, legal, financial advisory, risk advisory, and consulting services—yet our shared culture remains the same.

For us, good isn’t good enough. We aim to be the best at all that we do—to help clients realize their ambitions; to make a positive difference in society; and to maximize the success of our people. This drive fuels the commitment and humanity that run deep through our every action.

That’s what makes us truly different at Deloitte. Not how big we are, where we are, nor what services we offer. What really defines us is our drive to make an impact that matters in the world."

Established in 1984, Haier is the world's No. 1 major appliance brand. It has transformed from an enterprise that manufactures household appliances to a platform that incubates entrepreneurs for the whole society. In the Internet age, Haier aims to become a Networked Enterprise which overturns its self-contained enclosed system and fits into the Internet as a node that can connect various resources, with a view to building post-e-commerce ecosystems based on user value interaction for co-creation and winning together to add value for all stakeholders.
 
To forge itself into a real Networked Enterprise, Haier has carried out self-disruption in six aspects: strategies, organization, employees, users, compensation and management, so as to create a dynamic cycle system and accelerate the Internet transformation. Strategically, Haier establishes a user-centered ecosystem for co-creation and winning together to add value for all stakeholders; in the organizational structure, Haier changes the traditional enclosed system into an open node distributed on the Internet and turns the hierarchical organization into a networked one. During this process, Haier transforms its staff from employees and passive performers to entrepreneurs and dynamic partners, aiming to meet the individualized needs of users by means of community featuring ecosystems with best experience. In its compensation mechanism, ""pay by users"" has superseded ""pay by the enterprise"", driving employees to become entrepreneurs who create value for users while realizing their own value; In the management innovation, Haier has achieved self-evolution of leading goals through the exploration into nonlinear management.
 
On Haier's entrepreneurial platform there are two listed companies: Qingdao Haier (600690.SH) and Haier Electronics (01169.HK). The main focus of Haier Group is the innovation on three platforms: white household appliance platform, investment incubation platform and finance holding platform."
